Hey! My name is Aren Taylan, I'm a Computer Science major who loves developing games. I'm currently working on a custom 3D game engine in C++ using the OpenGL graphics library. Thanks a lot for visiting my website!
</p><br>

<p style="font-family: verdana;font-size: 18px; color:black;">
Within Computer Science, I am especially interested in and passionate about Artifical Intelligence, Engine Programming, Networking, and Computer Graphics. While Computer Science is my academic major and my personal focus, I have put time into developing skills in other areas relating to video games, such as art and design. By applying my varied skillset, I am a very efficient game developer. For more professional information, please look at my resume which can be found <a href="arenResume2019.pdf">right here!</a>!

<p style="font-family: verdana;font-size: 18px; color:black;">
On a more personal note, my interests are well-rounded, but when it coems to games, my favorites are Cave Story, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. I generally really love Nintendo games as well as RPGs and Adventure games. Some other series I am very close to are
Final Fantasy and Kirby, as well as 3D Super Mario games. I especially love games that have a good combination of fun game mechanics and an interesting story, like UNDERTALE and Cave Story. My goal is to someday make a game that I'll
love as much as I love all my other favorite games!
